When the #number element contains the number -1 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a number greater than or equal to 1".
When the #number element contains the number 4000 or greater and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a number less than or equal to 3999".
When the #number element contains the number 9 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "IX".
